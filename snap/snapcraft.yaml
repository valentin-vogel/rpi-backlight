summary: Backlight switch for Raspberry Pi
description: |
  RPI-Backlight is a very small tool written as bash script to switch the backlight on and off.
  It includes a timer to turn the lights off at 11pm and on at 06am. These parameters are fixed.

  The tool is build for a Raspberry Pi 3 setup running Ubuntu Core. Now it is based on Core18.
